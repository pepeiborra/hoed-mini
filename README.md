hoed-mini
=========

hoed-mini is a fork of Hoed minus the TH & SYB generators and the visual debugger.
Thus, it's little more that vanilla hood with GHC generics support.
hoed-mini adds a minor twist: hoed-mini provides a HO Observable1 type class for type constructors in the style of prelude-extras
